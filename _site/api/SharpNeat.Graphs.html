      <section><p>An alternative implementation of AcyclicGraphDepthAnalysis that uses function recursion.</p>
<p>This version is used for testing only. The main implementation uses a number of optimizations, one of
which is to use it own graph traversal stack instead of using function recursion. However, those
optimizations make the code harder to read/understand, and therefore that code has a higher
chance of containing defects.</p>
<p>As part of the unit testing of AcyclicGraphDepthAnalysis we use this implementation in parallel with
the optimized version, and check that both versions give the same results for any given graph.</p>

<p>This version is customised for sorting network connections. I.e. sort order is based on both source and
target node IDs (which are held in separate arrays), and a separate array of values is re-ordered to keep
the values at the same array index as their respective source and target IDs.</p>
<p>This functionality could be achieved by using the various sort() methods in the core framework, but less
efficiently than with this customised class, in terms of both speed, and also RAM allocations (and thus GC overhead).</p>

      <section><p>An algorithm for checking/testing whether a given graph is cyclic or acyclic, i.e. does a given graph have
a connectivity cycle.</p>
<h1 id="method">Method.</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>We loop over all nodes in the network and perform a depth-first traversal from each node.
(Note. the order that the nodes are traversed does not affect the correctness of the method)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each traversal keeps track of its ancestor nodes (the path to the current node) at each step
in the traversal. Thus if the traversal encounters an ancestor node then a cycle has been detected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A set of visited nodes is maintained. This persists between traversals and allows each traversal
to avoid traversing into nodes that have already been traversed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note. We must traverse from each node rather than just e.g. the input nodes, because the network may
have connectivity dead ends or even isolated connectivity that therefore would not be traversed into
by following connectivity from the input nodes only, hence we perform a traversal from each node and
attempt to maintain algorithmic efficiency by avoiding traversal into nodes that have already been
traversed into.</p>
<p>The graph traversal algorithm uses function recursion. A number of other classes in SharpNEAT perform
graph traversal by using a separate traversal stack (stored on the heap); that approach is faster but
more complex, thus this class has not been converted to the faster approach because it is not directly
used in the evolutionary algorithm. At time of writing this class is used only in Debug.Assert statements
and unit tests, thus the simpler implementation is more appropriate.</p>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="SharpNeat.Graphs.CyclicGraphDepthAnalysis.html">CyclicGraphDepthAnalysis</a></h4>
      <section><p>An algorithm for calculating the depth of each node in an cyclic graph.</p>
<p>Input nodes are defined as being at depth 0, and the depth of all other nodes is a determined as per the
following scheme:</p>
<p>Multiple separate traversals of the graph are made, one starting at each input node. Each traversal assigns
a depth value to the visited nodes, and where a node is on multiple paths, the highest depth value is recorded.</p>
<p>Once all traversal are complete, the average of all depths recorded against each node is calculated and rounded
up to the nearest integer. Finally, if the scheme has resulted in empty layers (e.g. a node allocated to depth 2,
but no nodes at depth 1) then the depth values are adjusted to remove the empty layer(s).</p>
<p>The motivation for this slightly convoluted scheme is to create 'balanced' depth allocations when large cyclic
loops might assign nodes very high depth values that might not be warranted, e.g. if most connections to a node
would assign it a low depth, but a single cycle assigns it a high depth. Use of a mean/average depth is a
compromise on the depth allocation of such a node. Median, min, or max could also be used, or indeed any aggregate
function.</p>
<p>The graph traversal algorithm uses function recursion. A number of other classes in SharpNEAT perform
graph traversal by using a separate traversal stack (stored on the heap); that approach is faster but
more complex, thus this class has not been converted to the faster approach because it is not directly
used in the evolutionary algorithm. At time of writing this class is used only for graph visualization.</p>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="SharpNeat.Graphs.WeightedDirectedGraph-1.html">WeightedDirectedGraph&lt;T&gt;</a></h4>
      <section><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Represents a weighted directed graph. The graph is described by an array of connections,
each with a source and target node ID and a weight.</p>
<p>The node IDs are actually node indexes, i.e. if there are N unique IDs referred to in the
connection array then the indexes run from 0 to N-1. An exception to this is when representing
graphs from a NeatGenome in which input and outputs nodes are given fixed IDs regardless of whether
they are connected to or not, however the use of a contiguous range of node indexes starting at zero
still holds in that case.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in sharpneat (e.g. in a NeatGenome) graph node IDs are not necessarily contiguous,
and thus any such graph representation must have its non-contiguous node IDs mapped to zero
based node indexes to be represented by this class. Such node ID mapping is outside the scope
of this class.</p>
<p>This class can represent both cyclic or acyclic graphs, however, SharpNEAT uses it in the
conversion of cyclic NeatGenomes only; a specialized class is used for acyclic graphs that
gives improved runtime performance for acyclic networks.</p>
<h2 id="specifics">Specifics</h2>
<p>The connection array is sorted by sourceID and secondary sorted by targetID. This means that all
connections from a given node are located in a contiguous segment, the start of which can be efficiently
located using a binary search. However to improve efficiency further an array of lookup indexes is compiled
which gives the starting index of a connection span/segment for a given source node index.</p>
