Connections are ordered by source node index, thus all memory reads are sequential, but the memory writes to node pre-activation variables are non-sequential.&nbsp; 2) Loop nodes.&nbsp; Pass each node\'s pre-activation signal through the activation function, storing the result in a separate post-activation signals array.&nbsp; 3) Completion.&nbsp; Copy the post-activation signals into the pre-activations signals array.&nbsp; The activation loop is run a fixed number of times/cycles to allow signals to gradually propagate through the network, one timestep/cycle/loop at a time.</div></div>"});
