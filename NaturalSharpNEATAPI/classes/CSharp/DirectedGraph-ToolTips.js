The graph is described by an array of connections, each with a source and target node ID and a weight.&nbsp; The node IDs are actually node indexes, i.e. if there are N unique IDs referred to in the connection array then the indexes run from 0 to N-1. An exception to this is when representing graphs from a NeatGenome in which input and outputs nodes are given fixed IDs regardless of whether they are connected to or not, however the use of a contiguous range of node indexes starting at zero still holds in that case.&nbsp; Elsewhere in sharpneat (e.g. in a NeatGenome) graph node IDs are not necessarily contiguous, and thus any such graph representation must have its non-contiguous node IDs mapped to zero based node indexes to be represented by this class. Such node ID mapping is outside the scope of this class.&nbsp; This class can represent both cyclic or acyclic graphs, however, SharpNEAT uses it in the conversion of cyclic NeatGenomes only; a specialized class is used for acyclic graphs that gives improved runtime performance for acyclic networks.&nbsp; Specifics --------- The connection array is sorted by sourceID and secondary sorted by targetID. This means that all connections from a given node are located in a contiguous segment, the start of which can be efficiently located using a binary search. However to improve efficiency further an array of lookup indexes is compiled which gives the starting index of a connection span/segment for a given source node index.</div></div>"});
